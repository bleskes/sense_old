Honesty first
-------------
This is an evening project which have gotten out of hand.
It has rough edges and probably bugs. The basic machinery is in place but there is still a lot that needs to be done.

I find it very useful. I hope you do too.

Installation
------------

Sense is installed as a Chrome Extension.Install it from
the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense/doinijnbnggojdlcjifpdckfokbbfpbo) .

As Chrome Extensions are practically a website, you can still install a Sense as a ElasticSearch site plugin:

    bin/plugin -install bleskes/sense
   
Note: this may not work in future releases.
